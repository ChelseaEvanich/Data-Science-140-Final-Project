# It answers the following Questions:
# Is gender compared to different columns of smartphone usage statistically significant for further testing?
# Does the younger generation use their phones significantly more than older users?
# How accurately can an age group be predicted through machine learning?
# To use this code simply run all cells and various graphs and tests with answers will be displayed
